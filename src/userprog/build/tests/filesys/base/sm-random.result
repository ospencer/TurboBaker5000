Call stack: 0xc002867e 0xc002bb2b 0x804a75c
Translation of call stack:
In kernel.o:
0xc002867e: debug_panic (.../../lib/kernel/debug.c:38)
0xc002bb2b: seek (...../userprog/syscall.c:250)
In tests/filesys/base/sm-random:
0x0804a75c: seek (...../lib/user/syscall.c:129)
Translations of user virtual addresses above are based on a guess at
the binary to use.  If this guess is incorrect, then those
translations will be misleading.
