Call stack: 0xc002867e 0xc002bac0 0x804a4f3
Translation of call stack:
In kernel.o:
0xc002867e: debug_panic (.../../lib/kernel/debug.c:38)
0xc002bac0: read (...../userprog/syscall.c:230)
In tests/userprog/read-boundary:

Translations of user virtual addresses above are based on a guess at
the binary to use.  If this guess is incorrect, then those
translations will be misleading.
